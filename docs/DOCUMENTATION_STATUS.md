# Documentation Status

Last full status reconciliation: **2026-08-21**. The architecture is now **Pajoniiir-M3 Single-Chip ESP32-P4** on the `JC-ESP32P4-M3-DEV` board. The ESP32-S3 co-processor has been retired. ESP32-P4 directly manages USB Host for Pioneer DDJ-FLX4 (USB MIDI + UAC1 Headphone audio), Rekordbox media storage (FAT32/exFAT PDB parser), 800×480 MIPI-DSI LVGL UI, and PCM5102A I2S DAC Master audio.

Latest live hardware verification: **2026-08-21**, on COM17.
- **Simultaneous Dual USB Host Operation (No External Hub)**:
  - **Port 8 (Top USB-C / HS)**: Mounted Rekordbox USB flash drive (`VID: 0x18A5`, `PID: 0x0302`) and loaded 191 tracks into active memory.
  - **Port 9 (Middle USB-C / FS)**: Configured internal FSLS PHY routing (`usb_wrap_ll_phy_select`) and claimed Pioneer DDJ-FLX4 MIDI Streaming (Intf 4).
- **Live Dual-Deck Performance & Playback**:
  - Browse navigation and track loading on Deck 1 and Deck 2 via physical DDJ-FLX4 controls.
  - Dual-deck audio playback started with physical PLAY buttons; 2290+ audio buffers streamed to I2S with 0 drops.
- **Pioneer DDJ-FLX4 UAC1 Isochronous Audio Streaming & MIDI Host**:
  - Direct 4-channel 16-bit 44.1 kHz PCM Isochronous audio streaming (Interface 1, Alt 2) to the DDJ-FLX4 3.5mm headphone jack.
  - Active MIDI In/Out for buttons, knobs, and LED illumination (Interface 4).
- **Master Audio**: PCM5102A I2S DAC (`GPIO50/51/52`) running at 44.1 kHz / 16-bit stereo.
- **Network**: Wi-Fi 6 provided exclusively via onboard ESP32-C6 over SDIO (ESP-Hosted). Ethernet EMAC held disabled to dedicate RMII pins to the I2S DAC.

This page explains which documents describe the current product and which are
historical design or validation records. Four states must not be conflated:

- **latest clean tagged release artifacts:** `RC2` (`56905c89`, built with
  ESP-IDF 6.0.2 on 2026-07-30; see
  `validation/CLEAN_RELEASE_RC2_BUILD.md`). The images were signed, packaged and
  later installed through OTA on both boards. That deployment is not full
  hardware acceptance;
- **previous release line:** `RC1-259-gdaf4639` (ESP-IDF 5.5.4, 2026-07-26).
  Superseded; `RC1` is closed and no further `RC1-*` builds are expected;
- **current bench state:** both boards successfully installed and reported the
  RC2 application through OTA on 2026-08-02. P4 was then fully wired-flashed
  with `RC2-3-g136aad7`; its boot log proves the ESP-IDF v6.0.2 bootloader and
  microSD mount. S3 was then full-flashed with the exact clean RC2 bootloader
  and application; image metadata confirms ESP-IDF v6.0.2 and the P4 control
  link reports the running S3 as `RC2`, `ota_0`, `VALID`. A focused functional
  smoke then passed the P4 UI/Settings/Library, FLX4 MIDI/LED and both product
  audio outputs. The attempted WAV row was a missing file in the PDB rather
  than a decoder run;
- **fully functionally hardware-accepted:** `RC1-123-g587cd7a1`, accepted on
  2026-07-14 after positive updates, the rejection matrix, interrupted uploads,
  forced rollback and final UI/audio/controller smoke. Later releases have
  extensive focused acceptance but have not replaced this complete-system baseline.

Since RC1-168 the product added and hardware-tested the single-resolver ANLZ
metadata path, the structured
`/sd/logs/system.log` service journal with its read-only
`GET /api/diagnostic-log`, controller disconnect and control-link CRC/gap
summaries, `/api/status` control-link/service-log health, Beat FX headroom
fixes, corrected loop timing, the
idle screensaver and P4 pull OTA through a temporary STA visit. The
master-output recorder and guarded `/api/recording` API remain in the tree but
are **compiled out by default since 2026-07-24** because card-level latency
stalls failed the long soak. Still open: the targeted Phase 20/E1A rows,
remote-profile replacement/recovery, enclosure endurance and production
hardening.

## Source-of-truth order

When documents disagree, use this order:

1. current firmware, host tests and build configuration;
2. active operational documents: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONTROL_LINK_PROTOCOL.md`,
   `DDJ_FLX4_MIDI_MAP.md`, `HARDWARE_WIRING.md`, `OTA-UPDATE.md`,
   `CONTROLLER_PROFILE_UPDATE.md`, `POST_R5_PLAN.md` and
   `STARTUP_CHECKLIST.md`;
3. dated validation records under `validation/`;
4. dated design records under `superpowers/specs/`;
5. imported or vendor reference material under `reference/`.

Dated design records are intentionally retained. They explain why a feature
was built, but their original pending tasks do not override the current status
in the active documents.

## Verified product snapshot

| Area | Current state |
| --- | --- |
| Controller | Pioneer DDJ-FLX4 enumerates on the S3 USB host; input mapping and P4-owned LED feedback are operational and were operator-confirmed again on the migrated RC2/IDF6 pair 2026-08-02 |
| Playback | Two independent P4 decks, Rekordbox library, MP3/WAV/FLAC, hot cues, loops, beat jump, sync and mixer controls; compressed audio uses a bounded LRU page cache (8 × 32 KiB per deck) instead of whole-file PSRAM allocation. Focused real-MP3 playback passed on RC2; real WAV/FLAC remain untested because those physical files were missing from the audited USB export |
| Vinyl | Forward/reverse scratch, paused/CUE scratch, loop wrapping and release/re-grab; canonical-only scratch storage and final dual-deck stress hardware-validated 2026-07-14 |
| Master Tempo | P4 key-lock callback and Overview `MT` control implemented; basic hardware behavior accepted 2026-07-12; deterministic five-minute simultaneous dual-deck host soak passed 2026-07-26 with zero source drift, detected clicks or clipping |
| Audio | PCM5102A RCA MAIN plus simultaneous FLX4 USB headphone cue via the P4-to-S3 PCM link; both paths were operator-confirmed on the migrated RC2 pair 2026-08-02, while the numeric sustained-link soak remains separate |
| Media | FAT32/exFAT on superfloppy, MBR and GPT USB layouts; immutable track records with compact double-buffered sort order. P4 ESP-IDF 6.0.2 now reuses ESP-Hosted's initialized SDMMC controller for microSD slot 0; a repaired 59,688 MB exFAT SDHC card mounted in 4-bit mode in the 2026-08-02 focused smoke |
| UI | Overview, Library, Hot Cues and Settings tabs; Library table is paginated (one 8-row page with PREV/NEXT, max 40 live LVGL cells); stopped-deck VU meters decay to zero; a pinned headless LVGL gate now drives real button callbacks and locks exact 800×480 screenshots for D1/D2, all tabs and the screensaver restore path; DSI-synchronised 49.981 Hz dual-waveform path passed the 132-second development smoke and a more-than-71-second exact signed-candidate COM15 re-smoke on 2026-07-17 with no underrun, visible flash, watery motion or jitter. Display, touch, PSRAM-backed UI, Settings SD-online state and paginated Library were operator-confirmed again on RC2/IDF6 on 2026-08-02 |
| Effects | Beat FX Filter/Echo/Flanger/Delay all have recorded hardware acceptance as of 2026-07-24 (Flanger re-tuned; Echo/Delay confirmed as-is). A measured headroom defect in all three - wet added on unity dry peaks at up to 3.34x and hard-clipped inside the effect - was fixed with a soft knee in `RC1-223-gdfa619a9` |
| OTA | ECDSA P-256 signed `.ddjota`, dual-slot update, rejection, interruption safety and forced rollback hardware-accepted on both targets 2026-07-14; both RC2 applications installed successfully through OTA on 2026-08-02; pull OTA is hardware-proven and now software-hardened with newer-only policy, offer expiry, channel hash/size checks, strict relative paths, mDNS and dynamic Host validation. OTA does not replace the bootloader, so the IDF 6 boot chain requires a wired flash per target |
| Profiles | SD loading, registry matching and S3 transfer are hardware-verified with FLX4; the independent `generic_midi_ci` profile is compile/registry/runtime/LED host-tested; atomic web overwrite/rescan/reactivation is deployed in `RC1-131-gc391e306` and still awaits dedicated hardware acceptance |

## Remaining work

- close the P1 and applicable P2 gates from
  [`CODE_REVIEW_REMEDIATION_20260816.md`](CODE_REVIEW_REMEDIATION_20260816.md)
  before claiming a new release candidate
  is hardware-accepted or production-ready;
- **ESP-IDF 6.0.2 hardware acceptance**: display/touch, paginated Library,
  FLX4 MIDI/UAC, PCM5102A and the focused monitor path now pass. USB MSC
  recovery, sustained monitor/cache counters, ESP-Hosted AP/OTA and migrated
  rollback coverage still must pass before RC2 can be release-qualified;
- re-export real WAV/FLAC fixtures, verify they physically exist under
  `Contents`, then hardware-validate bounded cache under sustained dual-deck
  MP3/WAV/FLAC load;
- define production key provisioning and rotation beyond the current backed-up
  `rel-001` development key, preferably with encrypted or hardware-backed
  signing;
- perform enclosure power, thermal, RF and long-duration audio soaks;
- run longer simultaneous dual-deck key-lock quality/CPU testing on P4
  hardware; the five-minute deterministic PC regression is complete but does
  not measure device deadlines or listening quality;
- close the detailed E1A Beat FX transition/timing/target rows that go beyond
  the recorded per-effect sound and headroom acceptance;
- run the Phase 20 USB queue-pressure/recovery, guarded web-mutation and UART
  integrity acceptance set;
- hardware-validate the host-proven `generic_midi_ci` path with a real
  non-FLX4 controller before advertising generic compatibility;
- hardware-accept web profile overwrite, corrupt/interrupted rejection,
  automatic S3 reactivation and reboot persistence;
- complete only the still-pending hardware rows identified in the MIDI and
  validation documents.

The one-time Deck 1 pad sweep observed for one initial load ordering is tracked
as a low-priority cosmetic indication. Routing, playback and pad state were
correct and no stack/audio fault accompanied it.
